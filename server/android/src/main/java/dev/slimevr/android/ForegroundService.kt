/**
 * ForegroundService helps to keep the SlimeVR Server on Android from being killed.
 * Especially when the process is in the background when the user is playing a game
 * or something else.
 *
 * Processes with foreground services on Android are less likely to be kill per
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#asem
 *
 * Tested with VRChat on Quest 3 in high population worlds with all avatars on
 * for over an hour with no shut down of the SlimeVR server. Without this service,
 * the server would often be shutdown unexpectedly.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 		Luckily this does not show anything visual over the running app.
 * 		The notification only shows in the alert panel and cannot be dismissed.
 * 		On Quest there's no way to manually kill the Slime Server, so you have to restart the device.
